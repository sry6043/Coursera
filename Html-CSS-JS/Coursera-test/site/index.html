	<p>Coursera was founded in 2012[6] by Stanford University computer science professors Andrew Ng[7] and Daphne Koller.[8] Ng and Koller started offering their Stanford courses online in fall 2011,[9] and soon after left Stanford to launch Coursera. Princeton, Stanford, the University of Michigan and the University of Pennsylvania were the first universities to offer content on the platform.[10] Offerings have since expanded to include Specializations – collections of courses that build skills in a specific subject – as well as degrees and a workforce development product for <span style="color:red">businesses&nbsp;and&nbsp;government</span> organizations. </p>
